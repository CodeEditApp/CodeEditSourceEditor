/// This class provides a thread-safe API for executing `tree-sitter` operations synchronously or asynchronously.
///
/// `tree-sitter` can take a potentially long time to parse a document. Long enough that we may decide to free up the
/// main thread and do syntax highlighting when the parse is complete. To accomplish this, the ``TreeSitterClient``
/// uses a ``TreeSitterExecutor`` to perform both sync and async operations.
///
/// Sync operations occur when the ``TreeSitterClient`` _both_ a) estimates that a query or parse will not take too
/// long on the main thread to gum up interactions, and b) there are no async operations already in progress. If either
/// condition is false, the operation must be performed asynchronously or is cancelled. Finally, async operations may
/// need to be cancelled, and should cancel quickly based on the level of access required for the operation
/// (see ``TreeSitterExecutor/Priority``).
///
/// The ``TreeSitterExecutor`` facilitates this requirement by providing a simple API that ``TreeSitterClient`` can use
/// to attempt sync operations, queue async operations, and cancel async operations. It does this by managing a queue
/// of tasks to execute in order. Each task is given a priority when queued and all queue operations are made thread
/// safe using a lock.
///
/// To check if a sync operation can occur, the queue is checked. If empty or the lock could not be acquired, the sync
/// operation is queued without a swift `Task` and executed. This forces parallel sync attempts to be made async and
/// will run after the original sync operation is finished.
///
/// Async operations are added to the queue in a detached `Task`. Before they execute their operation callback, they
/// first ensure they are next in the queue. This is done by acquiring the queue lock and checking the queue contents.
/// To avoid lock contention (and essentially implementing a spinlock), the task sleeps for a few milliseconds
/// (defined by ``TreeSitterClient/Constants/taskSleepDuration``) after failing to be next in the queue. Once up for
/// running, the operation is executed. Finally, the lock is acquired again and the task is removed from the queue.
///
