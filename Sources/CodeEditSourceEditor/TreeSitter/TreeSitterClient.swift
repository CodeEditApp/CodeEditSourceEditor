/// # TreeSitterClient
///
/// ``TreeSitterClient`` is an class that manages a tree-sitter syntax tree and provides an API for notifying that
/// tree of edits and querying the tree. This type also conforms to ``HighlightProviding`` to provide syntax
/// highlighting.
///
/// The APIs this object provides can perform either asynchronously or synchronously. All calls to this object must
/// first be dispatched from the main queue to ensure serial access to internal properties. Any synchronous methods
/// can throw an ``TreeSitterClientExecutor/Error/syncUnavailable`` error if an asynchronous or synchronous call is
/// already being made on the object. In those cases it is up to the caller to decide whether or not to retry
/// asynchronously.
/// 
/// The only exception to the above rule is the ``HighlightProviding`` conformance methods. The methods for that
/// implementation may return synchronously or asynchronously depending on a variety of factors such as document
/// length, edit length, highlight length and if the object is available for a synchronous call.
